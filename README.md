# 4dTicTacToe
4D Tic Tac Toe was created as a project at an A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. Meeting in December of 2019. Our goal was to create an ineresting piece of software over the course of 24 continous hours. The game was completed and playable within that time, but several more hours were put into refining it, and setting up the server which now hosts it. A team of 5 worked on this project, and are listed below. The client code is written in standard HTML Javascript, while the backend is written in Python. Communication is over Websocket. There is also a small amount of Dynamic Python involved in rendering the page, accomplished with our custom Web Server.

A playable version of the game can be found at:
